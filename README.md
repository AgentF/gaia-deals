## Gaia Deals

Gaia Deals is an eco-oriented peer to peer marketplace with a sustainable rewards program for its users. The main actors in this marketplace will be second hand goods like furniture, clothes and home items. So the more environmentally beneficial the deal, the better the rewards for both buyer and seller.

The basic workflow to complete a deal looks like this:

- A seller publishes an article to sell.
- An interested buyer finds that article and presses the buy button.
- The buyer adds his physical address data to calculate the shipping cost.
- In the checkout page the buyer gets the total amount (with discounts if own any badge) and proceeds to pay for the deal.
- A new deal is created for both buyer and seller and the amount is locked in contract until the buyer validates the arrival of the article.
- The buyer receives the article and unlocks the deal’s amount to be transferred to the seller’s wallet.
- Now both can leave a review and qualify each other.

The rewards will depend on a score that is determined by the age and the materials with which the article to sell is made. Once a deal is completed, these points will be added to the profile of the users involved. When a user manages to accumulate a certain number of points, they are awarded a badge (these vary depending on the milestones and have up to 3 levels) that gives them the possibility of opting for discounts and cashbacks in future deals related to the category of the earned badge.

The sustainable rewards program refers to the ability of the project to maintain user’s rewards over time without the need for external capital to keep incentives alive. Taking this into account, the idea is to place the income generated by the deals commissions in a Lending protocol (like JustLend DAO) to generate passive income, this income will be used to sustain the rewards program.
